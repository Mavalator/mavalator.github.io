<li>A large North America insurer, for example, implemented a range of digital levers, the most prominent being a photo-based claims app that can inspect damage to more than 70 percent of cars. The app also allows body-shop repairers to video-chat with claims adjusters for quick assessments. Overall, the insurer improved its net promoter score by 1.6 points and has improved its loss ratio by 0.5 percent.</li>
<li>An Italian insurer introduced an app-based platform that guides customers through the entire claims-management process, with immediate support from the service provider as needed. After two years on the market, more than 100,000 new customers are using the app and satisfaction scores are high.</li>
<li>Another large global insurer, which has earned the highest net promoter score for a fifth consecutive year, uses drones to investigate and assess damages. This has cut underlying claims-assessment costs in half. Along the claims journey, the client can switch from virtual assistants to real agents, but the insurer found that roughly 70 percent of the clients do not need or want human interaction. A virtual agent partakes in more than 1 million conversations with more than 500,000 members a month. More than 2.2M policy holders have subscribed to multi-factor authenticationâ€”using face, fingerprint or voice for identification to decrease fraud for policy holders.</li>
